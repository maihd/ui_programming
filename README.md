## Requirements
- Zig compiler

- `make dll` to create dynamic library, which is loaded at runtime by executable
- `make autodll` to automatically check change the lib.c file, and recompiled, executable will take effect immediately

With Windows batch:
- `build_exe.bat` to create executable
- `build_dll.bat` to create dynamic library, which is loaded at runtime by executable
- `auto_build_dll.bat` to automatically check change the lib.c file, and recompiled, executable will take effect immediately
